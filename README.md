# Neural Tac-Toe 🤖🎮  
### An AI-Driven Game & Learning Experiment

Neural Tac-Toe is an advanced Tic-Tac-Toe game built as part of my ongoing journey of
**developing intelligent, adaptive AI-based games**.

This project is not just about winning a game —  
it is about **training, reacting, adapting, and interacting with AI**.

---

## 🧠 Project Vision

Neural Tac-Toe is an evolution of my earlier AI game experiments.  
Each version improves on:

- Decision-making intelligence
- Adaptive difficulty
- Human-AI interaction
- Real-time AI personality via chat

This version introduces **Google Gemini AI** as a conversational opponent that reacts
to gameplay outcomes in real time.

## ✨ Features

- 🎮 **Adaptive AI Gameplay**
  - Easy, Medium, Hard, and Adaptive modes
  - Minimax-based decision making
- 🤖 **Gemini AI Chat Integration**
  - Context-aware AI reactions
  - Game-state-aware responses
- 🧠 **AI Training Concept**
  - AI difficulty adapts based on player performance
- 💎 **Modern UI**
  - Glassmorphism design
  - Neon highlights and smooth animations
- 🌐 **Runs Fully in Browser**
  - Hosted via GitHub Pages
  - No installation required

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**
- **Tailwind CSS (CDN)**
- **Google Gemini API**

---

## 🔑 How It Works

1. User provides a free Gemini API key
2. Game logic runs fully in the browser
3. AI gameplay uses deterministic algorithms
4. AI chat uses Gemini for contextual reactions

> This design keeps the project lightweight while showcasing real AI interaction.
